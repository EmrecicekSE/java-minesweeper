# java-minesweeper
A console-based Minesweeper game built in Java. I used 2D arrays to create the game board and a recursive function to reveal empty cells.
The game includes flag placement, random bomb generation, win/lose conditions, and core game logic.
This project was built to improve my Java programming skills.
