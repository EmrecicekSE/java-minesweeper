# Java Minesweeper Game

## Description
A console-based Minesweeper game built in Java.  
I used 2D arrays to create the game board and a recursive function to reveal empty cells.  
The game includes flag placement, random bomb generation, win/lose conditions, and core game logic.  
This project was built to improve my Java programming skills.


## Features
* Console-based gameplay
* Random bomb generation
* Recursive function of empty cells
* Flag placement system
* Win/Lose system
* Input validation (out of bounds check)


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile and run the 'Game.java' file
3. Enter board size (n)
4. Decide to plant a flag
5. Choose row and column values to play
6. Try to reveal all safe cells without hitting a bomb

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Scanner
- Random

## Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice Java fundamentals such as arrays, recursion, loops, and game logic.
